## WHAT IS A BLACK BADGE?

A Black Badge is one of the highest honors that DEF CON can bestow on a person or team in recognition of their overall elite skills or outstanding contribution to the security community.

A Black Badge is given by DEF CON to an individual in certain circumstances, and it entitles that individual, on presenting his or her badge, to free admission to the DEF CON convention. In order to protect individuals who hold a Black Badge, the privileges associated with a Black Badge are non-transferable.

If you have earned a Black Badge but don't see your name in the [Black Badge Hall of Fame](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-black-badge.html), please contact [info@defcon.org](mailto:info@defcon.org), and DEF CON Staff will attempt to verify your Black Badge. After verification of your Black Badge, DEF CON will add your name to the Black Badge Hall of Fame.
