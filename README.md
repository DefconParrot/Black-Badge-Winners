## WHAT IS A BLACK BADGE?

A Black Badge is one of the highest honors that [DEF CON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON) can bestow on a person or team in recognition of their overall elite skills or outstanding contribution to the security community.

A Black Badge is given by DEF CON to an individual in certain circumstances, and it entitles that individual, on presenting his or her badge, to free admission to the DEF CON convention. In order to protect individuals who hold a Black Badge, the privileges associated with a Black Badge are non-transferable.

If you want your name, or the name of a person you know who earned the Black Badge from DEF CON, to be added to this list, you can do so through a pull request or by creating an issue with the details.

### BLACK BADGE ISSUANCE AND REGISTRY

DEF CON has created a registry of the individuals who have earned Black Badges called the Black Badge Hall of Fame. The [Black Badge Hall of Fame is located here](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-black-badge.html).

In May 2014, all Black Badges began to be issued through the Black Badge Hall of Fame. Black Badges issued before May 2014 may not be currently listed in the Black Badge Hall of Fame and are subject to verification by DEF CON Staff.

If you have earned a Black Badge but don't see your name in the Black Badge Hall of Fame, please contact info@defcon.org, and DEF CON Staff will attempt to verify your Black Badge. After verification of your Black Badge, DEF CON will add your name to the Black Badge Hall of Fame.

### THE PRIVILEGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BADGE ARE NOT TRANSFERRABLE

The individual who originally earned the Black Badge, in combination with the Black Badge, is eligible for free admission, NOT whoever possesses the Black Badge.

### SALE OR TRANSFER OF THE PHYSICAL BADGE

A physical Black Badge may be sold by the original owner or team that earned it; however, any sale of a Black Badge will automatically negate all entitlements previously attached to the Black Badge or the earner of the Black Badge. If a physical Black Badge is transferred or sold, such Black Badge will be without DEF CON benefits to the new owner (e.g. the new owner will not have free admission to the DEF CON conference).

After a physical Black Badge is sold or otherwise transferred, the Black Badge Hall of Fame will still recognize the individual or team who first received the Black Badge.
